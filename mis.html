                                                    is a historic artificial pond located in the heart of Kathmandu.The square-shaped tank dates from the 17th century,
                                                    and was built on the eastern side of the then city limits. It lies just outside a former city gate.The pond is one of
                                                    Kathmandu's most famous landmarks and is known for its religious and aesthetic significance. Its dimensions are 180m by 140m.
                                                    Rani Pokhari was built in 1670 AD by King Pratap Malla, one of the most illustrious monarchs of the Malla dynasty that ruled
                                                    Nepal for more than 600 years. Pratap Malla had the tank constructed to console his queen who was distraught with grief after
                                                    their son was trampled to death by an elephant.He had water collected from various holy places and river confluences in Nepal

                                                    Mention of the practice can be dated back to the 3rd century BCE,while evidence of practice by widows of
                                                    kings only appears beginning between the 5th and 9th centuries CE. The practice is considered to have originated
                                                    within the warrior aristocracy in India, gradually gaining in popularity from the 10th century CE and spreading
                                                    to other groups from the 12th through 18th century CE. The practice was particularly prevalent among some Hindu communities,
                                                    observed in aristocratic Hindu families,and has been attested to outside South Asia in a number of localities in Southeast Asia, such as in Indonesia and Vietnam.

                                                    In Nepal, operating any form of telecommunication service dates back to 1970.
                                                    The first telephone line was introduced in Kathmandu with open wire trunk between Kathmandu and Raxual (Indian border town) in 1914.
                                                    But telecom service was formally provided mainly after the establishment of MOHAN AKASHWANI in B.S. 2005.
                                                    Later as per the plan formulated in the First National Five year plan (2012-2017 BS); Telecommunication Department was established in B.S. 2016.
                                                    To modernize the telecommunications services and to expand the services, during third five-year plan (2023-2028),
                                                    Telecommunication Department was converted into Telecommunications Development Board in B.S. 2026.
                                                    After the enactment of Communications Corporation Act 2028, it was formally established as fully owned Government Corporation called
                                                    Nepal Telecommunications Corporation in B.S. 2032 for the purpose of providing telecommunications services to Nepalese People.
                                                    After serving the nation for 29 years with great pride and a sense of accomplishment, Nepal Telecommunication Corporation was transformed
                                                    into Nepal Doorsanchar Company Limited (NDCL) from Baisakh 1, 2061. NDCL is a company
                                                    registered under the companies Act 2053 with 85% government share. However, the company is known to the general public by the brand name Nepal Telecom (NT) as a registered trademark.
