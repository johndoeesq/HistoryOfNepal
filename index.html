                                 Nepal is one of the most diverse places on earth, its culture and people as varied as its scenic attractions.
                                  The history of the Nepalese monarchy has been the integral and inseparable part of the history of Nepal.
                                   Nevertheless, Nepal has much more than Monarchs when it comes to realm of history.
                                   It has a Vedic past to boast about and a bright feature to look to.Being the one of the beautiful countries
                                   in the world ,Nepal has a beautiful and overwhelming history too.</p>

                                <p style="text-align:justify">The history of Nepal dates back to 11000 years.
                                The recent excavation in the Kathmandu valley has found out Neolithic tools.
                                These tools were used at the advent of Neolithic era and many of them date back to 9000 B.C.
                                 This tells about the pre-Aryan settlement in the then Nepal. These people were of Bhutanese-Mongoloid parentage.
                                  Nepal once again gets mentioned in the Hindu epic of Ramayana.
                                  It is said that Janakpur, in the Tarai Nepal, has been the birthplace of Sita, the wife of Rama.
                                   Nepal is mentioned as Kirat Pradesh in the epic Mahabharata that is said to be composed around 1000 B.C.
                                   This place has been mentioned many a times in the epic.
                                   It is mentioned that the concerned king supported Kaurvas against the Pandavas in the battle.
                                   In the years around 500 B.C, Nepal had many small kingdoms and the most powerful among them were Shakyas of Kapilvastu.
                                    It was in the house of one of the Shakya kings that Gautam Siddhartha was born. He got the name of Buddha when he was enlightened.
                                     In the later era Nepal fall under the rule of the Maurya. Ashoka finds mention in many of the rock edicts.
                                 In the post-Christ era, the Licchhavis of Bihar ruled Nepal. There are many historical edicts that glorify the reign of Licchhavis.</p>

                                <p style="text-align:justify">In 1950 the Rana was overthrown and royal authority was restored. Then in 1959 elections were held in Nepal.
                                However the king quarreled with the elected Congress and dismissed it in 1960. Under a new constitution of 1962 the king had all the real power.
                                 However in 1990 widespread protests led to the restoration of democracy. Nepal gained a new constitution and in 1991 elections were held.
                                 Then in 1994 a minority Communists government took power.
                                  However in 1995 the Supreme Court nullified the election results and reinstated the previous parliament.
                              In 1996 a Maoist (Communist) insurgency began in Nepal which severely damaged the economy. However a peace accord was signed in November 2006.
                              In April 2008 elections were held and a coalition government came to power. In May 2008 the monarchy was abolished and Nepal became a republic.
                               Nepal gained a new constitution in 2015.Today the population of Nepal is 29 million.</p>


                                <p style="justify">Nepal is currently as a developing country as major crisis occur on April 25,2015, when an earthquake
