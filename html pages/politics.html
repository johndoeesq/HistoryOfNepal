                                                    Rana dynasty (Nepali: राणा वंश; IAST:Rāṇā vanśa) is a Khas Rajput (Chhetri)dynasty from the Indian subcontinent
                                                    that ruled the Kingdom of Nepal from 1846 A.D until 1951 A.D, reducing the Shah monarch to a figurehead and making
                                                    Prime Minister and other government positions hereditary.The founder of this dynasty was Jang Bahadur Rana, who
                                                    belonged to Kunwar family which was then considered a minor noble family of Kshatriya status.Jang Bahadur was a son
                                                    of Gorkhali governor Bal Narsingh Kunwar and nephew of Mathabarsingh Thapa,the reigning Prime Minister of Nepal (1843–1845)
                                                    from the Thapa dynasty.After the Kot Parva in 1903 BS, Jung Bahadur Rana became the Commander-in-Chief.It was soon followed
                                                    by another Parva called Bhandarkhal Parva. Jung Bahadur Rana captured all the state power and became the Prime Minister and
                                                    Commander-in-Chief. He sent the junior Queen, Rajyalaxmi in exile and ousted Rajendra Bikram Shah and placed Surendra on the throne.
                                                    He got the title of ‘Maharaja’ from the king. He made the king only a nominal head. The king delegated all his powers and authorities
                                                    to him. He was authorized to carry out ‘pajani’, declare a war or make peace and sign treaties with any countries.
                                                    Thus, he fully consolidated his position and became the de-facto ruler of Nepal.
                                                    Thus leading to a great leader and surpresor of Nepal history ,the Rana Reign is considered to be
                                                    the period of developement in Nepal.The continued to rule until Falgun 7,2007 BS when finally the rule was over from the country.

                                                    The Kot massacre (Nepali: कोत पर्व) took place on 14 September 1846 when then Kaji Jang Bahadur Kunwar
                                                    and his brothers killed about 30-40 civil, military officers and palace guards of the Nepalese palace
                                                    court including the Prime Minister of Nepal and a relative of the King, Chautariya Fateh Jung Shah and
                                                    other seniormost ministers and army generals at the palace armoury (Kot) of Hanuman Dhoka in Kathmandu.
                                                    The Kot meeting was called upon by Queen Rajya Laxmi Devi after the same night murder of her confidante
                                                    Kaji Gagan Singh Bhandari while performing worship at his prayer room. The Kot meeting turned ugly and
                                                    eventually, Jang brothers and their supporters led an open court full-fledged assault on all his rival
                                                    participants in the meeting. This massacre led to the loss of power of political clans such as Chautariyas,
                                                    Pandes, Thapas, and Basnyats and that of King Rajendra Bikram Shah and Queen Rajya Laxmi Devi and ultimately
                                                    the establishment of the Rana autocracy in Nepal.

                                                  People’s Movement of 2006 is being regarded as great success in Nepalese history for it has
                                                    restored democratic rights of people and has established federal democratic republic in the nation.
                                                    It is also regarded as drastic revolution in the history of Nepal because this movement dethroned the
                                                    then King Gyanendra Shah from power and reinstated the dissolved House of Representatives (HoR) in 2006.
                                                    This was the rise of the period for bringing out Nepal from old and outdated system to the ruling of nation by law.
                                                    In one sentence, it can also be said as people joint and comprehensive efforts to bring democratic republic form of
                                                    government in Nepal leaving no any option for such absolute Monarchy. People’s movement of 2006/07 is taken as an
                                                    example of one ofhe largest peaceful movements in the world where hundreds of thousands of people had came on the
                                                    street against the King’s direct rule defying strict curfew orders.

                                                    Panchayat (Nepali: पञ्चायत) was the political system of Nepal from 1960 to 1990.
                                                    It was based on the Panchayat system of self-governance historically prevalent in South Asia.
                                                    The Panchayat system of governance was introduced to the Nepali political paradigm by the Late King Mahendra
                                                    through the Constitution of 1962. Although the system was named after the ancient Hindu system of governance,
                                                    where five wise village leaders would play the role of the judiciary in villages, it was in effect a modern
                                                    system that established political authority over the country through an autocratic monarchy guided by indirectly
                                                    elected representative bodies. Deeming that political parties were vulnerable to advances from groups with vested
                                                    interests and therefore considered detrimental to national interests, the Panchayat System established a party less
                                                    political environment with a nationalistic slogan of it being an indigenous system suited to Nepal.
                                                    The Panchayat System was bicameral, it had a national assembly called the National Panchayat and an upper house called the Raj Sabha.
                                                    The political system was four tiered, consisting of the Village/Town Panchayat, the District Panchayat, the Zonal Panchayat and the National Panchayat.
